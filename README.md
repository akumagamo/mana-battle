# Mana Battle
A strategic RPG 🧙⚔️🏰

This project is a laboratory for some software development approaches.
The objective of this project is not to deliver a game by date x, but instead
think "what is easiest to maintain and reason about architecture"? 

The project is developed with a focus on:

- testing
- continous delivery
- reusable components
- decoupled modules (even written in different languages)

When looking at the code, a good place to start is the `./specifications`
directory. It contains the game's features, from the point of view of an user
(or "gamer" if you prefer).
From there, you can see how the system is controlled to perform the actions
ordered by the user.
